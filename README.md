# NeuralNetworks

### DeepNeuralNetwork.ipynb
This file contains a Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of a deep neural network. It may include various sections describing the creation, training, and evaluation of a deep neural network. It may contain Python code as well as explanations of each step.

### LogisticRegression.ipynb
This file is also a Jupyter Notebook and contains the implementation of logistic regression. It may include examples of using logistic regression to solve specific tasks, descriptions of algorithms, and their applications.

### OneLayerNeuralNetwork.ipynb
This file is also a Jupyter Notebook and contains the implementation of a neural network with one layer. Similar to the first two, it may contain Python code, examples of use, and a description of the algorithm of a one-layer neural network.
